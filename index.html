            <p id="p_2">The kind most of us know from pizza is coarsely ground
            pork (and sometimes beef) with fennel, also known as “mild” Italian sausage.
            The “hot” variety adds spicy peppers, while “sweet” Italian sausage includes sweet basil.
            It can be sliced or loose, and prepared in different ways or with different spices.</p>
